Containers
##########

Containers are a virtualization environment that is used deliver services/applications and their dependencies in a lightweight package. Containers have largely become popular through the popular tool, docker, and has been widely adopted due to its lightweight nature and ease of use. The rise of the use of containers has lead to a governing body called the ``Open Container Initiative (OCI) <https://opencontainers.org/>_`` which has defined a set of standards/specifications for creating containers. OCI compliant tools follow the defined specifications and allows for other container technologies to work fairly seamless with one another. Containers are used for a variety of applications and services which include sidecar containers (largely for kubernetes), devcontainers (development environment), continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and more. Docker and Podman will be used here as starting points into learning about and using containers.
