Real-time operating systems (RTOS) are designed to process data as it comes in, typically without buffering delays. They are used in embedded systems where timing is critical, such as in medical devices, automotive systems, and industrial control systems. RTOS are characterized by their ability to manage hardware resources efficiently and provide predictable response times.
