Networking
##########

Networking allows for communication from one application to another which may exist on different machines. The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI model) is commonly used to describe networking communication between applications. As data is transmitted through the layers of the OSI model, metadata is added to aid in the segmentation, transmission, and reconstruction of the data packets.

Internet Protocol (IP) 
----------------------

The Internet Protocol (IP) is most commonly used to transmit data over the internet. In particular, it defines the address to a recipient much like a piece of mail. Version 4 (IPv4) and Version 6 (IPv6) are the most commonly used addresses which are outlined in the RFC 791 and RFC 2460 specifications.

IPv4 Addressing
---------------

IPv4 addresses are 32-bit addresses (2\ :sup:`32`; ie :math:`[0 - 4,294,967,296]` available addresses) divided across 4 octets (2\ :sup:`8`; ie :math:`[0 - 255]`) seperated by a period (``.``).

    IPv4 Addressing

For a local area network, the number of addresses typically suffices but globally, the IPv4 address space has been exhausted and moved towards the adoption of Version 6.

IPv6 Addressing
---------------

IPv6 addresses are 128-bit addresses (2\ :sup:`128`, ie :math:`[0 - 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456]` available addresses) divided across 8 quartets, where a quartet holds 4 hexadecimals (2\ :sup:`16`; ie :math:`[0-65535]` typically denoted as :math:`[0-9A-F]`),

    IPv6 Addressing

.. note::
    IPv6 leading zeros are commonly shorthanded to provide a shortened address for easier reading.
